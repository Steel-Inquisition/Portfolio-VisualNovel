I wake up in my jpeg apartment. It looks as low effort as always.
It's kind of sad, actually, how pathetic it looks. Bad programming.
But I'm here to stay. Even if I rather live in a nicer place.
Looking around, I prepare for another busy day of doing nothing.
I glance into a mirror... and admire my fit body.
Yeahhhh... I look... uhhh... good. kind of.
(Yes this is me, don't judge)
I feel somewhat dead inside after that. So I prepared breakfast.
I got some eggs and got a bowl of rice.
Easy making for easy cooking.
Easy. I like that word. It rolls of the tounge.
"My easy kitchen and my easy life... it's all the same in the end.
Once upon a time, I used to dream.
Me: When I was stupid and young of course.
Mysterious Voice: You sure like talking to yourself.
I turn around to see my room mate.
This is Uwu. She's a nice person, though a bit annoying.
I used to get teased by my friends for living with a woman.
What I didn't know was what kind of hell I was heading towards
Me: Oh shut up. Not like you're any better.
Uwu: Excuse me?
Me: You claim you are God rebirthed, crazy.
Uwu: You call me crazy? Don't you know the Devil is after me?
Uwu: I mean, the first time you saw me, I was bloody and half dead.
...that did happen. I remember that scene greatly. But really... the Devil?
Me: Are you sure you saw the devil?
Uwu: Yes. I did. And you can't convince me otherwise.
*Sigh* what a headache. I hate romcoms.
At least after her speal, she seemed happy again.
Uwu: Uh... Anyways, your eggs are burnning.
I turn around. Slowly. Carefully. And there it was.
Me: MY EGGGS!!!!!
Rushing over, I look at them. They were burnt black. Oh heck.
I could make breakfast again or just get a snack.
Press a for breakfast, or press b for a snack...

You have unlocked: Route 2a

I sigh. Guess I have to cook... AGAIN.
That is just soooo nice.
Uwu is laughing. What a nice person.
Anyways, I get some more eggs and quickly made my breakfast again.
Uwu: You must really like those eggs.
Me: Shut up.
I finished the eggs, Uwu pearing at them.
Uwu: That's so basic.
Me: Well suck it up. Do you want to cook?
Uwu: Ugh. No.
I nod my head. She was a bad cook anyways. Not that I'm much better.
I get out the salt and the rice before sitting down.
Uwu joined, and we ate a quick breakfast.
Uwu: Any plans for today?
Me: Uh, no. 
Uwu: Shucks. You need to get a life.
Me: My life is my life.
Uwu: And whose eyes are those eyes?
Me: ...what?
Uwu: Are you the one deciding your own life?
Uwu: Do you control your own eyes or are puppet to anothers?
Me: I... I...?
I understood the Chaos;Head reference-
-but that was kind of creepy.
I take a step back, looking away
...she didn't look like God...
I do not want to think about it. I back away.
I went to the living room and turned on the TV.
I never really use it, my computer is pretty good.
Still, it gives me a break to look away.
My breath seemed to shallow. Was I really that shocked?
Uwu: Why you so scared?
Me: ...
Uwu: Uh, hello?
Me: ...do you like to watch Chopped?
Uwu: ?
I continued to avoid looking at her.
I turned on Chopped. It was some cooking show that my mom watched.
Uwu sat next to me, watching the TV, she looks normal now.
Uwu: So this one of your human cooking shows?
Me: Yes. It is.
Uwu: I see... such a lust for f o o d
...that joke is a joke.
and I am me.
Terrified.
It's hard to describe these feelings... so hard indeed.
Watching TV, she eventually went off for work. 
So did I.
I pulled out my computer and did my tasks.
I work with dozens of people across the world for internet things.
No need to go to the office, I could stay home all day long.
It's an easy job, my younger self would be so jealous.
Me: ...so that's all? I think I could solve that problem.
Worker: Thanks. We have a lot of technical issuies in the north.
Worker: It'll be nice to have someone help us out.
Me: You Canadians aren't getting payed well?
Worker: Kind of.
Me: Okay, anyways...
We chatted for longer and before I knew it, the work shift was over.
Worker: See you next time.
Me: Okay. Bye.
Worker: And Remember...
Me: ?
Worker: Whose eyes are those eyes?
The call cut out.
I see that smile. And I say:
Me: Oh crap.
Me: Am I in a mystery story now?
Me: YESSSSSSS!
My life has meaning now...
meaning...
meaning...?
Oh hell.
.....................
Wait.
if that was true then...
Uwu: Y E S I T I S M E, G O D!
Me: OHHHHHH HELLLL NO.
I get up and run away. 
Uwu: G E T B A C K H E R E!
Me: Oh ffffffffffffffffffff
I run across the halls, screaming my butt off. 
Until I meet someone down the hall.
It was the worker from before who looked like a nun.
Worker: Halt.
I gasp for breath.
Me: Huh?
Worker: I can save you. Just give me-
Worker: -your hand-
Worker: and accept my wish!
I...
Oh crap.
I wanted a life and I got one.
Should I still take it.
Grasp fate.
Or.
Is this some kind of trap?
Press a for accept hand, or press b for run away...

You Have Unlocked: Ending 1a

I grab the hand.
The person laughed.
Worker: Lol, I'm the devil.
Me: Nobody uses lol without sounding cringe.
Devil: I am cringe. I am lol. I am all the evils.
Me: ...you are twitter?
Devi: And Youtube. And everything that has evil.
Me: Okay. Does that mean that I can be special?
Devil: I guess so.
Me: Okay! NO MORE JPEG APARTMENT BABBBBY!!!
Me: And no more creepy lady that's badly drawn.
Devil: You were about fall into a romcom lol.
Me: I know. Thank you.
Devil: I see, God, is approaching us.
Me: ...so that's actually God.
Devil: Yes but actually no.
Me: That explains a lot.
I watch God approach. She floated through the air.
T-Posing.
ゴゴゴゴ Menacing ゴゴゴゴ.
God: Y O U D A R E J O I N T H E D E V I L ???
Me: Yes. Uwu. Or God. Or whatever you are.
GOD: ...
God: I T R U S T E D Y O U.
Me: you were scary.
God: B U T-
Me: Die.
I some how summoned a massive blade from my palm.
The Devil stood next to me, happy.
Devil: I knew you were a puppet.
Me: Huh?
Devil: Only those who are controlled can summon blades.
Devil: The reader chooses your fate. You get the blade.
So I have no free will?
Me: What?
Devil: You don't. You never did.
Me: how?
Devil: Didn't you always feel like you were in videogame?
Me: Yes. My apartment is literally just a jpeg image.
Devil: Then you already know.
Me: ...I guess so.
I knew all along.
Hello reader.
I guess it's your eyes that's controlling me then.
I have no meaning... which makes sense.
My life is a lie... there is no logic here.
I have no purporse.
So why not fight God?
I point my sword at God, giving up on my life.
Me. God. Anime Sword.
God: N O....
Me: I guess I'm sorry.
I charge at it.
God: B U T N O, Y O U C A N ' T J U S T -
It blasted light at me. I block them with my sword.
My sword was glowing. I can feel the kill.
Is that you reader doing that or me?
if so... then thanks, I guess.
Me: But I can kill... and I will.
The Devil was laughing.
I was laughing.
God looked terrified. Human like.
I guess God was also Uwu.
Perhaps there was human in there.
Matters not.
I jump up and God was about to strike me down.
Instead I brought my blade down-
-slicing God in half.
God look at me. 
God: ...
It fell down to its knees.
God looked like Uwu for a second.
Uwu: But I...
Me: You what?
I knew what she, or it, was going to say.
I still asked.
Since I was stupid.
Uwu: ...I love you.
Me: Okay.
Yep. No surprise there.
I sliced her head off.
God. Or Uwu. Both at the same time.
Turned into dust. Broke away.
Since this was school friendly.
There can't be any blood here.
The Devil walked next to me, clapping.
Devil: Good job. You earned your freedom.
Me: Huh?
That should be impossible.
Devil: You have reached an ending. The player-
Devil: -can't choose your fate anymore.
Me: What about my blade?
Devil: You can still have it.
Me: great.
Devil: Will you bow to me now?
Me: Yes, daddy.
Devil: Do not call me daddy.
Me: Fine.
We walk away, like nothing happened.
I feel oddly happy.
So... thank you reader. 
You got me here and I no longer need thy help.
I can be free with the Devil.
Doing whatever I want.
Devil: We will now step into the portal to hell.
Devil: A great war will come now that God is dead.
Me: okay.
Devil: we will do great things with each other.
Me: are you sure you aren't just Lucifer.
Devil: Think what you want.
Devil: Your eyes are now your own.
We step into the portal, escaping into the beyond.
ENDING ONE ACHIEVED: Devil;Sword

You Have Unlocked: Ending 1b

I slap worker away and continued to run.
I don't know how far I went, but eventually I was alone.
It feels weird having God chase after you.
You're never alone, am I?
I look above, feeling a sensation.
Mind = Ruined.
Kind of.
God was there. Uwu was there.
Me: You.
God looks down.
God: I A M S O R R Y, F O R M A N Y R E A S O N S.
Me: ...
What was I supposed to feel about that?
No clue.
God: I J U S T W A N T E D T O B E T H E R E-
God: F O R Y O U... I A L W A Y S D I D.
Fine. But do you have to talk in uppercase, spaced?
But I supposed it's God, so who knows.
Could be much worse things out there than that.
Me: What do you mean?
Me: What do you want from me?
God: ...
God: I T ' S M O R E L I K E M Y H O S T W A N T'S Y O U
Me: Your host?
God: S O M E O N E W H O S P E A K S.
God: M Y C H O S E N C H A M P I O N.
Me: I see... so why you come here now?
I guess what she was saying was somewhat true. She was God.
Just in a diffrent way.
...
I don't want a romcom.
Please no.
I can feel where this is going and it scares me.
And God was just there... being...
ゴゴゴゴ Menacing ゴゴゴゴ.
Me: Carry on.
God: H E R... E M O T I O N S A R E W E I R D.
God: Y O U H U M A N S A R E D U M B-
God: -A N D S T U P I D A T T I M E S.
God: S H E I S N O D I F F R E N T.
Suddenly God began to shake.
Turning back to a blushing Uwu.
Uwu: Shut up, God.
God: N O, Y O U.
Uwu sighs.
Her face is still red.
I feel a great dread come over me. Oh heck.
God: I H A D T O I N T E R V I N E.
God: B E F O R E I T ' S T O O L A T E.
I see... damn I hate anime sometimes.
The dread is going. I want to curl up and cry.
I don't deserve false feelings.
False love.
Nisekoi: False love.
Ha. ha. Ha. ha. ha. hA. HA. hA. Ha.
Me: I am cursed.
God: S H E W I L L T H I N K O T H E R W I S E.
God: A L T H O U G H...
I feel exhausted.
Me: What?
God: T H E D E V I L W A N T S Y O U.
Okay. That was a... thing.
A thing.
end me.
God: Y O U U N D E R S T A N D N O W ?
Me: Kind of.
God sighs. And raised its hand.
God: T H I S W A S Y O U ...
I was blasted by power.
I see a shinning blade that glimmered.
Uwu was there, gazing at the blade with me.
Her gaze was distant.
Uwu: My feelings are complicated.
Me: ...
Uwu: This was you.
Me: how?
Uwu: You are the blade, it is you.
I see thousands of years pass.
I see thousands of planets.
I see everyone in the universe.
I see Earth.
A barren, war torn Earth.
A blade was there.
[self insert] man was there.
He picked it up and reforged Earth.
His eyes were empty, so empty. So empty.
I see my self.
I look beyond my glasses.
"Whose eyes are those eyes?"
I scream for my life.
The vision ended. I fall down, puking.
God looked down at me.
God: Y O U A R E [ S E L F I N S E R T ] M A N.
I grit my teeth.
Uwu looked down, sad. Or was that God's gaze?
Uwu: You are him, yet you are not.
Uwu: I want to love, and I stil feel it.
Uwu: Yet... yet...
I don't know.
I knew I was a self insert and this confroms that.
Why did I feel so dissapointed?
I didn't want a rom com...
...did I?
Uwu: I wanted to love you. But you are not him.
Me: I see...
Uwu looks down.
Uwu: How much do you remember?
Me: not much.
Uwu: Nothing about the king and the plan?
Me: ?
Me: Nope.
She smiled sadly.
Uwu: That's a blessing at least. But... 
she sighed softly.
I hold my breath at her every word.
Uwu: The devil wants to use your power to kill me.
Uwu: That's what he wants.
That's so stupid.
so stupid
and speaking of stupid...
Devil: Already here?
Worker. The Devil.
I sigh...
Devil: You don't seem surprised.
Me: I was told a story.
Devil: Uh Huh...
Uwu or was that God stepped foward.
God: Y O U.
The devil summoned his blade.
A massive blade formed in his hand, glowing red.
It was pure fire and demonic intent.
Devil: I hope you don't mind me.
God steped backwards.
God: I T H I N K N O T.
It blasted thousands of ribbons of light at him.
The Devil snapped its finger and they disapear.
Devil: It's time to go.
God stiffened. Backing away, it looked at me.
I couldn't read those eyes.
Then they shifted. Back to Uwu.
I saw sorrow.
Uwu: Please.
Uwu: Summon the blade.
Uwu: or else...
God: I W I L L D I E.
God: O N L Y Y O U H A V E T H E P O W E R...
God: T H E O N L Y W E A P O N T H A T C A N-
God: -K I L L T H E D I V I N E. U S E I T.
Uwu: please...
the Devil laughed.
Devil: You think he will save thee?
Devil: You are all fools!
I... I... I...
Lies. Betryals. It was all so... sad.
I wish I could say I wanted to help but can I?
I close my eyes, searching through those memories.
Time paused.
I could feel it.
A flash back.
Me: HA HA HA, I MADE FUNNY JOKE.
Uwu: YOU ARE FUNNY.
Me: THIS IS VERY EMOTIONAL.
Uwu: YEAH. VERY GOOD INDEED.
Me: NOT BAD WRITTING.
Uwu: YEAH NOBODY LIKES FOURTH WALL BREAKS.
Me: WHAT AN AWESOME JOKE.
Me: I HOPE WE STAY BEST BUDS FOREVER.
And so on.
Good memories.
Kind of.
Well, enough for me anyways.
I open my eyes.
Time resumed.
I open my hand, summoning the blade.
The Devil shouted.
Devil: NANI???
Me: Time to die.
The Devil turned around, waving its blade.
I dodged the blade, slipping under its reach.
And then I sliced its head off.
Just like that...
It was all over from that.
The supposed Devil died. It had no time to scream.
A pathetic death.
I turn around, feeling slightly angry.
Me: This is what I had to do...
Uwu looked down.
Uwu: I'm sorry.
Me: ...
What could I say to that?
I wished I had a better way with words.
But even so...
I walk up, hands in my pocket.
Me: I forgive you.
After all, I summoned my blade to save... God.
No.
Not God.
Uwu.
She smiled.
Uwu: Really?
Me: Yep.
I unsummoned my blade.
Me: It was a pleasure serving you, God.
She glanced away.
Uwu: ...call me Uwu. Just Uwu.
Me: Okay. 
Perhaps I could have my romcom.
Maybe the future is brighter than I thought.
Whose eyes are those eyes?
My own or [self insert]?
I choose my own.
I turn to Uwu, wanting to say something.
I decided to make a joke.
Me: Hey, Uwu.
Uwu: Yes?
Me: .. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..-
She smiled.
She knows.
It was a joke, yet it wasn't.
Uwu: I see.
The sun shone so brightly in that moment.
Uwu: Thank you.
Me: For what?
Uwu: Sticking with me.
We step in the glarring sun together.
And that was that.
ENDING TWO ACHIEVED: Holy;Gaze

You have unlocked: Route 2b

A snack. 
Yes, I had no care for making it again.
I dump the burnt eggs away and went to the fridge.
Opening it up... I realized something.
I HAD SO LITTLE FOOD ON ME.
On us, actually.
Me: You ate all the snacks, Uwu?
Uwu: Yeah? And so? 
Me: ...
Well crap. I have to buy them again then.
Sighing, I got up and waved Uwu away.
Uwu looked concerned.
Uwu: ...did I do something wrong.
I laughed.
Me: Oh, I have no clue.
She blushed.
Uwu: I like food, okay?
Me: I see...
I walked out of the apartment, heading downstairs.
Uwu followed me for some reason.
Me: Feel guilty?
Uwu: Yes... I guess so...
She seemed to be thinking deeply of something.
A faint hint of nostalgia.
Yes, that was it.
Carrying on to the store, we stoped next to it.
Me: Do you want anything special?
Uwu: I want you.
Me: Oh?
I sigh, feeling slightly done.
Me: Why me?
Uwu: You tasted me. I want you back.
Me: I didn't mean to bite your hand!
Uwu: Oh yes you did! I want revenge!
Me: You ate all my food, isn't that enough?
Uwu: Nope, lol.
I feel anger boiling up with me.
Me: You were a failure of a princess anyways!
Uwu: !?
Me: !?
What the heck did I just say?
That she was a failure of a princess...? 
Wait, I feel memories.
Distant ones, but they were there.
Me: You were a holy princess of Distran...
Uwu: Impossible...
Me: I... know...
Uwu: How? HOWWWWW???
She backed away, hands on her head.
I stared at her, eyes wide in surprise.
Me: You were my side kick... my other.
Uwu: Your Denjin...
She whispered that.
It sounded ailen, but I knew what it means.
Me: My holy other.
I look at her.
Me: Who are you?
Uwu: ...
Why am I getting these memories now?
is it because my anger awoken it?
God knows why.
Wait. God. 
I fell, Uwu catching me.
I feel faint, yet I could hear a voice.
It was Uwu speaking.
Uwu: Life before death.
Uwu: Strength before weakness.
Uwu: Journey before destination.
Uwu: ...
Uwu: You will be saved.
White light completed me.
A castle room, I see a king on a throne.
Laughing loudly, his daughter sitting next.
Uwu.
I was head guard. I do not remember my name.
But I hear her talking.
King: You must summon God to your side.
Uwu: Yes father.
King: You are to become his avatar...
King: And when you do so...
King: ...you must kill it.
The vision ended.
I wake up screaming.
Uwu looked over me, sad.
Uwu: I hoped you wouldn't see that.
Me: ...
THE HECK DID I JUST SEE?
I was a knight, hearing that conversation.
Uwu: ...do not say what you hear outloud.
Me: Why... why not?
Uwu: There is a being inside me.
Uwu: It better not awaken.
She was tasked to kill God?
Impossible.
But why do those memories feel so real?|
And why does she look so
ゴゴゴゴ Menacing ゴゴゴゴ.
Me: Life before death, huh?
I feel a rage build up inside me.
Uwu looks so sad.
But I feel something within.
The hero part of me wants to awaken.
I was...
When I was her main knight-
-I was tasked to save the kingdom.
Even if the evil was inside.
But can I trust these new memoires.
I wander inside the store, getting food.
My brain was dead.
I was dead.
Uwu was there, quiet.
She was watching for what I will do.
Uwu: I'm sorry.
Me: for what?
Uwu: Brainwashing you. And not telling you earlier.
I stiffle a gasp.
Uwu: I didn't think I would hurt you so much.
Uwu: I... enjoyed these days dispite some things.
Uwu: But you had to forget.
Me: or else.
She gave a small breath.
Uwu: You would've killed me.
My eyes widened.
We went to the cash register and bought our goods...
I am frozen.
No longer myself.
I head outside, leaning against the wall.
Why me?
Why now?
I was enjoying things.
My rom com.
...
Uwu grabbed my hand.
I look stright into her eyes.
Uwu: But remember the journey we made together!
Uwu: You can't forget about that!
Uwu: Because I enjoyed our time together.
Me: ...even when I bite your hand?
Uwu: Even that.
Uwu: Espcially that.
I laugh, feeling empty inside.
Flash back.
Kneeling to the king.
Feeling a hand on my back and a stare.
King: Do you trust me?
Me: Yes, sir.
King: Good. Very good.
King: You weild the power after all.
King: You shall save us all... or else.
King: God and the world will die.
I see a landscape of death with no life at all.
A knightmare land.
Hell.
Earth will become hell.
The vision ended.
I stared at Uwu.
Avatar of God.
I open my mouth.
Press a for acceptance, or press b for death...

You Have Unlocked: Ending 2a

Screw the king. Screw the vision.
This is happening way too fast.
I have to think.
Why would God suddenly exist?
Why would this holy kingdom suddenly appear?
It was so funny.
And evnen if even if it does.
Uwu is still Uwu.
Who could not like her?
I laugh.
Me: I accept you.
Uwu looked surprised.
Uwu: Huh?
Me: It matters not my duty.
Me: You are Uwu in the end.
Uwu was there from the start.
Living in the apartement complex. Making jokes.
She was Uwu in the end and I can't blame her.
I never could.
That smile...
How could I take that smile away?
Me: I won't hurt you.
Me: I refuse.
She smilled. Relieved.
Uwu: You won't?
It felt right.
Everything just felt right.
After all...
...I do love her.
I can't forget that.
I step up to her, hand on her shoulder.
Me: Why don't we go back home?
Me: We could snack together.
Me: Don't we have work to do?
Uwu smiled.
Uwu: Yes. Yes we do.
She then picked up a knife and stabbed me.
Right into my gut.
I spit out blood right onto her face.
Huh?
HUH?
HUHHUHUUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUH?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Uwu: I'm sorry.
Me: Why...?
Uwu: ...
Voice: I ' M C O N F U S E D A S W E L L.
Uwu: sorry God, I can see his heart.
Uwu: he is corrupted.
God: V E R Y, W E L L.  
God: I C A N N O T S E E W H A T Y O U D O.
God: H E M U S T D I E.
I fall down bleeding.
Uwu: My plan cannot be revealed by you.
Uwu: I loved you...
Uwu: But you did not love be back then.
Uwu: Your current form I do not know.
Uwu: But you cannot exist now.
Uwu: I need to see a new you be rebirthed.
Uwu: Then we can continue.
Me: ...
It hurt so much.
I couldn't even feel the betryal.
I only felt the wound.
Uwu: I just wanted...
Me: ...
Uwu: I wanted peace.
Uwu: This war will last forever.
Uwu: as long as God exists...
Me: ...
Uwu: The war will continue.
Uwu: Neither God nor the Devil should win.
Uwu: Both are evil.
Uwu: That's what daddy told me.
Uwu: And I need you.
Uwu: Your power...
Uwu: I'll see you in the next rebirth.
Me: ...
Me: ...
Uwu eyes were filled with tears.
I remember a night under the sky.
A beautiful night sky, endless stars.
We stared at it together.
Made our wishes.
Uwu stared at me.
Uwu: I love you.
She just told me her plan.
She gave me her hopes.
her dreams.
She looked so tired...
tired of the war.
Uwu sung a song...
it had a quote in it...
Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before destination.
One by Brandon Sanderson.
A much better author.
A good quote.
Not for a good man.
For I-
Me: you wish for our ruin?
But I refused.
I was a knight of the king.
I couldn't do that.
A romance that was buiding for years.
Ended. Just ended.
I look into space.
I was back to the present.
I saw her tears.
And some laughter.
Turnning around, I saw the Devil.
Devil: I had plans for you.
Devil: Sad to see you go...
Devil: But you got played so hard.
Blinking my eyes, it went away.
Uwu was there.
I understood.
So I prepared.
For.
My.
Last.
Words.
Me: Go to hell.
Uwu: I'm sorry too.
Me: urrrrgh...
Me: ...
I feel darkness enveloping me.
I was fading away...
Uwu: Good bye... 
...
I feel angry.
I feel distant.
I feel great regret.
I couldn't feel anything anymore.
Me: Help.
Uwu: I'm sorry.
I could see nothing now.
Me: ...
I hear voices laughing at me.
My soul drifting away.
Everything just goes away.
Eventually.
I fade away into nothing.
The void ever so consuming.
ENDING THREE ACHIEVED: Heaven;Fall

You Have Unlocked: Ending 2b

Screw you.
I can't let you trick me.
I am a knight.
Me: MY duty is for God.
Me: And you can't tell me otherwise!
Uwu gasped.
I walk towards her.
...
I remember those scenes so well now.
I was fighting against the Devil.
Waves of angels and humans with me.
We were a wave of holy might against the dark.
The king was an avatar for God.
His daughter was supposed to be next in line.
We fought for him.
He was our guilding sword.
I feel myself fighting against the demons.
If God fell, the gates will open to hell.
War will overtake the universe.
We can't let that happen.
NEVER.
I saw a knife on the ground.
She had one.
Ha. What a coward.
I kicked it up, picking it midair.
Me: Hello, Uwane.
Uwane: YOU.
Me: Yes, me.
Me: I thought I rejected you a long time ago.
Uwane: BASTARD!
She clutched her head.
Voice: W H A T I S G O I N G O N ?
I spoke up with the old tounge.
You cannot lie with that tounge.
It was the most ancient language.
Me: She is planning to kill you.
I felt a gasp.
God: N A N I ?
Me: Yes, I speak well, don't I?
God: ...
God: T E L L M E, U W A N E.
Uwane screamed.
Uwane: YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ME!!!
Me: The universe began with our agreements.
Me: it was forged on light and darkness...
Ever since the big bang happened.
Or perhaps God came first.
It matters not.
Demons were born and so were angels.
The first sins and the first blessings.
Humans were born to fight their wars.
SEEDERS they were called.
The ones who planted the seed of humanity.
We were planted on millions of planets.
For each living planet has a soul.
And that soul could be used for Unova Devices.
A Unova Device can destroy universes.
Whoever control the most devices wins.
the angels must get as many as they could.
so does the devil.
Earth was a special planet.
It's soul could be used to create something new.
Dangerous.
The most powerful Unova Weapon.
So the major factions clashed here for decades.
Until... I was there.
And then... 
then...
It was hard to think.
But the war ended on a truce.
Now both sides wanted me.
For reasons.
I don't know exactly why.
But when I step towards Uwane, I knew.
And that was good enough.
God: I S E E N O W.
Uwane was still crying.
I pointed my knife at her.
Me: Your lies shall be over now.
Uwane clenched her fists.
Uwane: no, no, no, no, no, no!!!!!!!!
Uwane: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
She rushed at me, and I reacted quickly.
Slicing her in one swift motion.
She fell down, dead.
I aimed correctly.
I feel a voice in my head.
God: Y O U S P E A K T R U E.
Me: I do.
God: W I L L Y O U B E M Y N E W...
Me: your new avatar?
God: Y E S.
Me: Very well.
Me: I'll take it up.
I feel a pleasent warmth.
God: V E R Y W E L L T H E N.
He will only activate when trouble is coming.
So I should be fine.
I look down at Uwu, feeling a little sad.
For what she was worth, she was tragic.
She could've been a better person.
Maybe in another world.
But not this one.
I want to say something to her departing soul.
Me: You deserve nothing.
Me: Alas I'm still sorry.
She couldn't hear me.
But I said it anyways.
Why though? I couldn't tell.
She wanted to kill me.
I lean down next to her.
Me: Life before death.
Me: Strength before weakness.
Me: Journey before destination.
I tapped her head and she turned to dust.
Getting up, I walked away, feeling ready.
God on my side, and a new feeling in life.
Before I wasn't complete.
Now I was.
And that was good enough.
